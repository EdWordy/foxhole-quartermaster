# foxhole-quartermaster
An application for compiling and tracking stockpile data for the game Foxhole.

*NOTE: Heavily WIP*

## For Most Users

1) Download the latest release (.exe)
2) Run the program

NOTE: The included files such as the item_ and number_mappings are necessary, including the Reports directory (which is where generated data will be placed).

## Goal(s)

1) A simple stockpile management tool that involves screenshots, and translating those screenshots into spreadsheets.
2) Ease of usage for all players.
3) Powerful analytical tools and insights.

## TODO

-All the item mappings are not finished; I play warden, and have yet to finish updating the colonials weaponry, and most of the vehicles.
